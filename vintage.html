    <p>Never shall it cease to amaze me how the phrase old is gold is asumed.</p>
    <p>No matter how far we move on we should take sometime and look back.</p>
    <p>Can't lie if am fascinated by all old programming languages that's my nearest application.</p>
    <p>Let's say one day i might learn C++ or even C# syntax i don't know maybe am an 'old is gold Believer' if thats a thing.   
    </p>
    <p>Weird! Yes maybe give me a chance - why! You listen. </p>
    <p>Some people might even consider them as myths 'You included'.</p>

        <h1 id="headers">Authenticity in the Old.</h1>

        <p>Yes maybe before all this mainstream people liking this and that you know</p>
        <p>Trend setting and all that you get me.</p>
        <p>Before all the adrenaline, the rush, you know anyways i link that to alot of things.</p>
        <p>Let's say before minimalism was wiped clean yes i know maybe it was never a thing.</p>
        <p>But ever  thought it was maybe practised unknowlingly?</p>
        <p>Anyways am just trying to explain to you the why i link old age with some genuine culture.</p>
        
        <p>For example: I hope you got parents right? Ever seen how they judge things</p>
        <p>Ever thought of their need to keep things simple.</p>
        <p>I don't know why thats common to them but it dates back to the old ages.</p>
        <p>Anyways am a man of application all that can be summarised by </p>
        <p>Back in the days i think people chose satisfaction rather than the need for want.</p>

      <section id="vintageMindset">
        <h2 id="headers">Vintage Mindset</h2>
        <p>Vintage isnt just about materialism.</p>
        <p>It's a mentality, i mentioned C++ and all that yes release of python is better some say...</p>
        <p> this better than this...what for though!</p>
        <p>In the quest of progress we lose sight of where we came from.</p>
        <p>Am not sure it's human meantality but in the long run we should appreciate</p> 
        <p>the focus of satisfaction rather than sheer excess. </p>

        <h3 id="headers">Nostalgic Pull</h3>

        <p>What's wrong with having sweet genuine memories over rapidly fleeing dopamine?</p>
        <p>I found a picture while 20yrs old and another while 5yrs old.</p>
        <p>Which one sparks lots of memories?</p>
        <p>Anyways for me ill pick up the 5yr old one i feel its more attractive from the soul.</p>
        <p>Maybe chat gpt could help spark meaning in this statement step back think abit.</p>

        <h4 id="headers">Final Take</h4>

        <p>Guess i can say am Old is gold believer!</p>
        <p>As much as i value new things Vintage is more like a philosophy and a calling.</p>
        <p>It's about appreciating the layers of meaning that come with age and appreciating what has influenced our main ideoligies.</p>
        <p>Yes it's a calling to cherish the old in a world of fleeting trends.</p>
